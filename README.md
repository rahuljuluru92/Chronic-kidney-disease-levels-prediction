# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

The Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction project is aimed at predicting the stage of CKD using machine learning algorithms. The model provides an accurate prediction for the diagnosis of CKD based on various features such as age, blood pressure, specific medical conditions, and other health-related attributes. The project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), to predict the likelihood of kidney disease.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models Used:**
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree (DT)
  - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Data cleaning and handling of missing values
  - Feature selection using statistical methods
  - Data normalization and scaling for model performance

- **Performance Evaluation:**
  - Accuracy: 92%
  - Precision: 88%
  - Recall: 91%
  - F1-Score: 89%
